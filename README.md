This is work example for Raksul.
I made it for a few hours, mainly focus on design structure of database.
Some basic code CRUD for phones and unit tests.

Next ideas:
- Implement i18n instead of hard text
- Add photos/gallery for phones
- Add feature tests to test end-to-end: visit page, fill_in form, see something
- Implement authenticate with devise and users model
- Build api documentations
- Build landing page, admin pages
- Add payment to website
- Add report or chart to see details of sales
- Implement import function, to import multiple records
- Implement export function to see data
